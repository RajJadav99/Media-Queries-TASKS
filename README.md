## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is a complete **Responsive Design Practice Lab** where I built multiple real-world layouts using different Media Query strategies.

The main focus is learning how websites intelligently adapt across:

- 📱 Mobile
- 📲 Tablet
- 💻 Laptop
- 🖥 Desktop

Everything is built using **pure HTML + CSS only (no frameworks)** to strengthen core fundamentals.
